Retrieve Contacts/Show Location

Assignment Instructions:
1.  Create a recycleView that will display all contacts on your device
2.  Create a Detail fragment to display greater details on a contact once clicked on
3.  Using the Locations project I uploaded as a template, Implement the location listener in a way so that when you move, the marker on the map moves with you.
